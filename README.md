# Adyen Payment plugin for Magento2
Use Adyen's plugin for Magento 2 to offer frictionless payments online, in-app, and in-store.

## Integration
The plugin integrates card component (Secured Fields) using Adyen Checkout for all card payments. Local/redirect payment methods are integrated with DirectoryLookup and HPP. For Point Of Sale (POS) payments we use Terminal API using Cloud-based communication. Boleto and SEPA are a direct API integration into Adyen.

### Support Vault and Instant Purchase ###
Inside Adyen toggle the following settings on inside the API and Responses section (Settings -> API and Responses):
* Recurring details
* Card bin
* Card summary
* Expiry date
* Variant

## Requirements
This plugin supports Magento2 version
* 2.3.7 and higher
* 2.4 and higher

## Support & Maintenance

We provide three levels of support:
1. **Level 1 (12 months)**: full support (including new features) *Keep in mind that some new features are not possible on older versions, therefore this is not inclusive of ALL new features that are built.* 
2. **Level 2 (12 months - 18 months)**: high priority bugs / security only.
3. **Level 3 (18 months - 24 months)**: security updates only (no support from support team).

> After Level 3 there is no support or maintenance from Adyen and it should be treated as a native integration of the merchant.

The schedule for the current maintained branches is:

|  Plugin Major Version   |  Release Date  |  Level 1 Support ends   |  Level 2 Support ends   |  Level 3 Support ends  |
|  :-----          |  :-----          |  :-----          |  :-----          |  :-----          |

## Setup Cron
Make sure that your Magento cron is running every minute. We are using a cronjob to process the notifications (our webhook service) and to update Adyen servers' IP addresses. The cronjobs will be executed every minute.

```
<group id="adyen_payment">
    <job name="adyen_payment_process_notification" instance="Adyen\Payment\Model\Cron" method="processNotification">
        <schedule>*/1 * * * *</schedule>
    </job>
    <job name="adyen_payment_server_address_caching" instance="Adyen\Payment\Cron\ServerIpAddress" method="execute">
        <schedule>*/1 * * * *</schedule>
    </job>
</group>
```

The notification processing service queries the records that have been received at least 2 minutes ago. This is to ensure that Magento has created the order, and all save after events are executed. A handy tool to get insight into your cronjobs is AOE scheduler. You can download this tool through Magento Marketplace or GitHub.

If you need to setup your cronjob in Magento <a href="http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.0/config-guide/cli/config-cli-subcommands-cron.html" target="_blank">this is described here</a>.
